[h1]Calamity Loot Swap[/h1]
Lets you switch between drops from Calamity bosses using new "Manipulator" items

Notes: 
[olist]
[*] Manipulators have a 100% drop rate from most bosses
[*] You can craft the Manipulators with the boss' ""expert"" drop
[*] This mod will implode without Calamity on
[*] Profaned Guardians and Eidolon Wyrm don't have items as they do not have any alternate drops with the same drop rate.
